# My Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my Arch Linux laptop. Feel free to fork this and make 
them your own. I also have branches for other systems I use, so check those out 
as well. They're mostly all similar, with my desktop being the main system.

## To Do
- [ ] Clean up vimrc and remove CoC.
- [ ] Set up vimrc for use on multiple machines and VPS. Remove unnecessary plugins, aside from theme and nerdtree.
